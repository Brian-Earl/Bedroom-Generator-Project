# Bedroom Generator

Created by Brian Earl and Justin Kreiselman using the Godot Engine.

The application procedurally generates a bedroom with furniture using grammars with help from a port of [Tracery](www.tracery.io/) thanks to [Althar93](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/388).
Pieces of furnature are randomly generated and placed in a bedroom which are then represented as letters.
Hovering over a letter displays a description of said object. 

Pressing the R key regenerates a new room.
