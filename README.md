#Bedroom Generator

Created by Brian Earl and Justin Kreiselman
Created using Godot Engine.

The application procedurally generates a bedroom with furniture using grammars.
The objects are randomly selected and placed in a bedroom and are represented as letters.
You can hover over a letter to get a description of the object. 

There is currently one style of room that can be selected.

Press the R key to regenerate a room.
